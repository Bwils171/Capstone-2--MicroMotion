# Capstone-2--MicroMotion
 Capstone Project about Involuntary Head Movement

This project is currently in progress and some workbooks are in an incomplete state. After performing data cleaning and EDA on the demogrpahic, music and motion data, I am moving to start modeling using a number of techniques. The goal is to be able to predict participant movement based upon prior movement, music and the persons demographic info.
